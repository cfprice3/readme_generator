### *Project Description:*
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. 
The application will be invoked with the following command: "node index.js"

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the 
GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions 
about their project.

to download the needed package.
